## [7.2.3] (2023-11-23)

#### :exclamation: Breaking Change

* InvoicePayment/Reconcile: Change the link between the models

The previous link between Reconcile and Invoice Payment was a list of reconcile in the invoice payment and a link to the payment in reconcile. Now, the link will be just a link to the reconcile in the payment.

This technical change means that existing payments on invoice must be migrated to avoid issues. Please run the following SQL script on your database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE account_invoice_payment ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reconcile bigint;

UPDATE account_invoice_payment payment SET reconcile = (SELECT id FROM account_reconcile reconcile WHERE reconcile.invoice_payment = payment.id) WHERE payment.reconcile IS NULL;

UPDATE account_invoice_payment payment SET reconcile = (
	SELECT MIN(reconcile.id) FROM account_reconcile reconcile 
	INNER JOIN account_invoice_term_payment itp ON itp.invoice_payment = payment.id 
	INNER JOIN account_invoice_term it ON it.id = itp.invoice_term
	INNER JOIN account_move_line ml ON ml.id = it.move_line
	WHERE reconcile.debit_move_line = ml.id OR reconcile.credit_move_line = ml.id) WHERE payment.reconcile IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE account_reconcile DROP COLUMN invoice_payment;
```
