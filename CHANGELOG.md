```sql
ALTER TABLE account_invoice_payment ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reconcile bigint;

UPDATE account_invoice_payment payment SET reconcile = (SELECT id FROM account_reconcile reconcile WHERE reconcile.invoice_payment = payment.id) WHERE payment.reconcile IS NULL;

UPDATE account_invoice_payment payment SET reconcile = (
	SELECT MIN(reconcile.id) FROM account_reconcile reconcile 
	INNER JOIN account_invoice_term_payment itp ON itp.invoice_payment = payment.id 
	INNER JOIN account_invoice_term it ON it.id = itp.invoice_term
	INNER JOIN account_move_line ml ON ml.id = it.move_line
	WHERE reconcile.debit_move_line = ml.id OR reconcile.credit_move_line = ml.id) WHERE payment.reconcile IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE account_reconcile DROP COLUMN invoice_payment;
