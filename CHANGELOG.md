#### Database change

* App account: fixed the configuration to activate invoice term feature.

For this fix to work, database changes have been made as a new boolean configuration `allowMultiInvoiceTerms` has been added in `AppAccount` and `hasInvoiceTerm` has been removed in `Account`.
If you do nothing, it will work but you will need to activate the new configuration in App account if you want to use invoice term feature. Else it is recommended to run the SQL script below before starting the server on the new version.

```sql
  ALTER TABLE base_app_account
  ADD COLUMN allow_multi_invoice_terms BOOLEAN;

  UPDATE base_app_account
  SET allow_multi_invoice_terms = EXISTS(
    SELECT 1 FROM account_account
    WHERE has_invoice_term IS TRUE
  );

  ALTER TABLE account_account
  DROP COLUMN has_invoice_term;
