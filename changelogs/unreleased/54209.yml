title : "Invoice Line : choosing a product from a supplier catalog in an invoice line now has the same behavior as a purchase order line"
type: fix
description: |
  In an invoice line :
  Choosing a product from a supplier catalog takes the product name from the supplier catalog.
  If there is a minimum quantity, the user is alerted that the quantity is inferior than the minimum quantity.
  Choosing a quantity inferior than the minimum quantity doesn't remove the product name anymore.
