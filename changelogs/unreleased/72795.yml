title: "LOCALIZATION : new object to manage all localization related elements"
type: feature
description: |
  A new Localization object is created. It has:
    a String field "code";
    a String field "name";
    a M2O field "language" related to Language object;
    a String field "dateFormat";
    a String field "numbersFormat";
    a M2O field "country" related to Country object.
  We use this object to manage all the localization related elements, the language, 
  the date format and the numbers format. And we use this object everywhere we select a language.
