title: Replaced lost action by a an existing
type: fix
description:
  Replaced on field 'currency' in 'onChange' attribute "action-move-record-set-currency-code" by "action-move-method-set-default-move-currency".
  Modify 'setDefaultCurrency' in 'MoveDefaultServiceImpl' by adding 'move.getPartner() == null' in if condition, so now when a company is chosen and a partner exist, we don't override
  the partner currency by the company currency.
