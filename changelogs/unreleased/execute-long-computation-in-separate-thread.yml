title: "Processes that are too long are now executing in the background instead of making the user wait."
type: change
description: |
  If the process is taking too much time, the user will get a message to inform
  him that the process is still ongoing. The timeout value is configured in
  appBase.  When the process is finished a notification is sent using mail
  message. This change is fixing time-out errors.
  Implemented for MRP, closing period with accounting module, and all batches.
