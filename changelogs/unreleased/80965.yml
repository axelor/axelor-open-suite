title: "MoveReverse: fixed imputation on reverse move invoice terms."
module: axelor-account
developer: |
  To fix existing data if you reversed a move related to an invoice, you can run the following script:
  
  ```sql
  UPDATE account_invoice_term AS it 
  SET amount_remaining = 0, company_amount_remaining = 0, is_paid = true
  FROM account_move_line ml JOIN account_move m ON m.id = ml.move
  WHERE ml.id = it.move_line AND ml.amount_remaining = 0 AND m.invoice IS NULL;
  ```
