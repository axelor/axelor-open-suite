title: "UserService: Follow coding good practices"
module: axelor-base
developer: |
  The service `UserService` and its implementation `UserServiceImpl` have been refactored to follow good practices:
    * Deprecate `UserServiceImpl.DEFAULT_LOCALE` constant which was unused.
    * Introduce a constructor `UserServiceImpl` to inject services. Affects child classes `UserServiceAccountImpl` and `EmployeeServiceImpl` too.
    * Remove unthrowable exceptions from method signatures.
