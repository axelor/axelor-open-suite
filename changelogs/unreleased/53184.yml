title: "Payment: cancelling a payment from an Invoice or an Expense must go through the reverse of the move"
type: fix
description: |
  When registering a payment in an invoice or an expense, the move generated will often be in Daybook mode.
  So the cancel button of the payment will indicate to the user that cancelling this Invoice/Expense payment must 
  be done by reversing the corresponding move.
  If the move generated from the payment is not accounted, it will be deleted, and the Invoice/Expense payment will be cancelled.
