title: "APPCONFIG / COUNTRY / ADDRESS : Introduce the usage of string and groovy template method to compute addresses based on a template defined by country."
type: feature
description: |
  In order to provide more flexibility to the international users, we will extend some features in order to allow to customize by country the address formatting in order to fit to the needs of postal address all around the world.
  The current system is based on the french formatting of addresses which can be applied to some countries but lack flexibility to match other countries standards.
  
  Updated processes to format the address, per example when we select an address on an invoice or an order. We don't need to format the address in these processes anymore
  
  Updated the demo-data in base_country.csv file to add address template column value.
