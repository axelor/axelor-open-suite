title: "MAIL TEMPLATE ASSOCIATION: fix template keys issues when using custom template for mail notifications on comments"
type: fix
description: |
  In the custom mail template used for mail notifications sent when commenting on a form, following changes were made:
  - Fix variable $ccRecipients$ so it is filled with all followers.
  - Add variable $toRecipient$ which is currently the same as $ccRecipients$
  - Add variable $commentCreator$ to only get the author of the comment.
