title : "MOVE : functionnal origin - display on form view"
type : change
description: |
  Display the field 'functionnal origin' only if at less two values are allowed on the selected journal. Means we hide the field if :
  - no functionnal origin is allowed on the journal
  - only one value is allowed. In this case we automatically fill it on the accounting move and hide it.
