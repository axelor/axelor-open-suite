title: "Analytic axis by company: fixed analytic axis display error."
module: "axelor-account"
developer: |
  "In accounting configuration, the field `analyticAxisByCompanyList` had previously a sequence starting with 0. However, since the upgrade of the framework to v7, the sequence of this list now starts with 1. 
  The processes that previously assumed a starting sequence of 0 will now be adjusted to start from 1 in order to align with the behavior of AOP.
  
  If you use this configuration, after this patch please make sure that this sequence is starting with 1 in your database."
