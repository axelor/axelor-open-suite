title: "PARTNER : improve registration number management"
type: feature
description: |
  On a partner entity, a designated attribute named "registrationCode" is employed to encapsulate a company's registration identifier. 
  Specifically, in the context of France, this identifier corresponds to the SIRET, and the validation procedure for this identifier
  is statically coded to accommodate the unique validation requirements in France.
  
  On a Partner based on the business country for company registration number template has been introduced to accommodate registration numbers. 
  This template incorporates a validation selection, facilitating the designation of the appropriate validation class for a given country. 
  For instance, the selection of the class responsible for validating French registration numbers is denoted by "RegistrationNumberValidationFRA."
