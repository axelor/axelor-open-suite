module: axelor-human-resource, axelor-business-project
developer: |
  New fields have been added to the TimesheetLine domain
  Customize 'timesheet-line-timesheet-form' to add those new fields to the timesheetLine form
  Update the 'save' method of TimesheetHRRepository to copy the value of timesheetLine.adjustedOvertimeDuration into timesheetLine.durationForCustomer when saving the timesheet, only if timesheetLine.isExtraHours is true
  Edit 'InvoicingProjectAnnex.rptdesign' to add another data set 'TimeSheetLines ExtraHours DS' that selects only timesheetLines with isExtraHours = true and display this data in a new table
  Update the existed data set 'TimeSheetLines DS' to retrieve only timesheetLines with isExtraHours != true
