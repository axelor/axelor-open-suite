title : "APP ACCOUNT : Add a way to know if the application can have multiple invoice terms."
type: fix
description: |
  For this fix to work, database changes have been made as a new boolean configuration `allowMultiInvoiceTerms` has been added in `AppAccount` and `hasInvoiceTerm` has been removed in `Account`.
  If you do nothing, it will work but you will need to activate the new configuration in App account if you want to use invoice term feature. Else it is recommended to run the SQL script below before starting the server.
  ```sql
    ALTER TABLE base_app_account
    ADD COLUMN allow_multi_invoice_terms BOOLEAN;

    UPDATE base_app_account
    SET allow_multi_invoice_terms = EXISTS(
      SELECT 1 FROM account_account
      WHERE has_invoice_term IS TRUE
    );

    ALTER TABLE account_account
    DROP COLUMN has_invoice_term;
  ```
