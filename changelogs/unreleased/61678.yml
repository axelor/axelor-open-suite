title: "Use the account config of the company in actions"
type: fix
description: |
  We were comparing the value of the field "activate simulated move?" in the context with the value of the first account config in database.
  Instead of comparing it with the one corresponding to the company we are working on.
  After the changes we made, the value of activate simulated move is now compared to the right value.
