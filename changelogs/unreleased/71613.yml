description: |
  Create a process to export and import translations in different languages.
  A new field called isNative is added to each language obj.
  The native ones are English and French, which cannot be exported or imported.
  Other available languages can be exported into a csv file, and can be modified by user after downloading.
  After modifying a translation csv file, users can import the file to make changes of translations in the system.
