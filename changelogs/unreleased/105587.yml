title: "Sequence: fixed unit tests after sequence management refactoring."
module: axelor-base
developer: |
  Following the sequence management refactoring (ticket 105427), unit tests in TestSequenceService
  were failing because they relied on mocked SequenceComputationService.

  Changes made:
  - Removed TestSequenceService.java: tests were redundant as the same functionality
    is now tested in SequenceComputationServiceTest
  - Updated SequenceComputationServiceTest.java: added missing test cases migrated from
    TestSequenceService (uppercase/lowercase letter sequences, null lettersType handling)
  - Removed unused method isSequenceAlreadyExisting() from SequenceService.java
