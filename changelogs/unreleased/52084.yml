title: Correclty add title lines when 'Do not display the header and end of pack' is checked
type: fix
description: |
  On pack the boolean 'Do not display the header and end of pack' was also affecting title lines.
  It is no longer the case and a title line is well added on the sale order when we add the pack no matter the value of 'Do not display the header and end of pack'
  ```
  $ find -iregex ".*domains.*.xml" | xargs -l sed -i 's|cachable="|cacheable="|g'
  ```
