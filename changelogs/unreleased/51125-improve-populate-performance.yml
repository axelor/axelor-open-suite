title: "Skip expensive computation of available qty of product when possible"
type: change
description: |
  The dummy field `$availableQty` appears on `Product` grid views. It's computation done on 
  StockMoveRepository.populate will now be triggered if and only if the boolean `_xFillProductAvailableQty`
  is true.
  
  Migration steps:
  1. Locate usages of `$availableQty` in `Product` views
  2. Locate the action-views using these views and set the context variable `_xFillProductAvailableQty` to true
  3. Locate usages of the views from point 1 in `grid-view` attributes and set the context variable `_xFillProductAvailableQty` to true thanks to onLoad and onNew attributes of the parent view.
