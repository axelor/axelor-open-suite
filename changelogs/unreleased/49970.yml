title: Quantity is the same for all products in internal stock movement print
type: fix
desscription: |
  When option "Display line details on printing" in stock configuration, 
  identical products are regrouped in the printed file.
  Instead of summing identical products, 
  the application makes the sum of all products and allocate this number to 
  the quantity of each product.
  
  Corrected birt report to get rid of the anomaly.
  Quantity is now displayed correctly by product type.
