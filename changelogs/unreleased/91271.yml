title: "Company: Add fields to store light and dark logos which will be used according to user theme mode."
module: axelor-base
developer: |
  Dont' forget to run the SQL migration script to create the new columns and constraints.
  
  The methods `getUserActiveCompanyLogo` and `getUserActiveCompanyLogoLink` expect now a string argument with the theme mode (light or dark).
  When this method is called in the axelor-config property `context.appLogo`, AOP automatically provides the expected query-parameter so there is nothing to change.
