title: "Company: Add fields to store light and dark logos which will be used according to user theme mode."
module: axelor-base
developer: |
  Dont' forget to run the SQL migration script to create the new columns and constraints.
  
  The methods `getUserActiveCompanyLogo` and `getUserActiveCompanyLogoLink` expect now a string argument with the theme mode (light or dark).
  When this method is called in the axelor-config property `context.appLogo`, AOP automatically provides the expected query-parameter so there is nothing to change.
  
  The service `UserService` and its implementation `UserServiceImpl` have been refactored to follow good practices:
    * Deprecate `UserServiceImpl.DEFAULT_LOCALE` constant which was unused.
    * Introduce a constructor `UserServiceImpl` to inject services. Affects child classes `UserServiceAccountImpl` and `EmployeeServiceImpl` too.
    * Remove unthrowable exceptions from method signatures.
