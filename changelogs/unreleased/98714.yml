module: axelor-human-resource
developer: |
  If you have some expense with another currency than the company currency, you will need a script to reset it.
  
  Script : 
  UPDATE hr_expense e SET currency = c.currency
  FROM base_company c WHERE c.id = e.company AND e.currency != c.currency;
  DELETE FROM meta_action WHERE name = 'action-expense-attrs-kilometric-panel-visibility';
