title: "Blocking: improved code organization for purchase blocking"
module: axelor-purchase
developer: |
  The `PURCHASE_BLOCKING` constant has been moved from `axelor-base` to `axelor-purchase` module
  for better modularity.

  **Migration:** No action required. The entity package remains `com.axelor.apps.base.db.Blocking`,
  so existing imports continue to work.
