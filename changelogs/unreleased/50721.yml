title: adding a custom field for cities to visualize both city name and postal code
type: feature
description: |
  Added a fullName field in City object composed of name and zip code.
  This data is used as a name when selecting a city from a list generated
  in a many-to-on relation and is more generally used to describe a city, as
  multiple city entities can have the same name but different zip codes.
