  Created new interface and class `StockLocationAttrsService' and 'StockLocationAttrsServiceImpl`. 
  In `stock-location-form` changed parentStockLocation onSelect action from `action-stock-location-attrs-set-parent-stock-location-domain`
  to `action-stock-location-method-set-parent-stock-location-domain`, the former action has not been removed.
