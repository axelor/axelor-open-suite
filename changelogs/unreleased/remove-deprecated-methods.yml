title: "Removed deprecated java methods"
type: remove
description: |
  The following java methods were deprecated and are now removed:

    * AppBaseService#getTodayDate() (replaced by getTodayDate(Company))
    * In AxelorException.java, the constructors AxelorException() and AxelorException(String message, int category, Object... messageArgs)
    * QueryBuilder#create() (need to call build() instead)
    * YearServiceAccountImpl#computeReportedBalance2
    * RefundInvoice#refundInvoiceLines
    * SaleOrderService#getReportLink

  If you had modules calling these methods, you will need to update them so they can be compatible with Axelor Open Suite v6.3.
