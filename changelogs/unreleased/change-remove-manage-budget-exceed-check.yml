title: "PurchaseOrder : do not manage budget exceed in supply chain module"
type: change
description: |
  The budget exceed check called when requesting a purchase order can no longer be managed from supply chain module, as there is now different types of budget exceed checks that are managed directly in budget module.
  Also, the check is now more of an informative message than an error message blocking requesting action.
