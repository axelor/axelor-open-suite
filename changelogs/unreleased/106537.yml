title: "Move line consolidation: fixed an issue where the process could hang indefinitely when consolidating move lines with analytic distributions of the same size but different values."
module: axelor-account
developer: |
  Refactored MoveLineConsolidateServiceImpl.findConsolidateMoveLine() method:
  - Removed unnecessary while loop that could cause infinite iteration
  - Added proper return statement when analytic move lines have same size but different values
  - Simplified null checks for analytic move line lists
