# Contributing Guide

We’d love for you to contribute to our source code and to make app even better.

there are a few guidelines we’d like you to follow:

* [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement)
* [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues)
* [Submitting](#submitting)

## Contributor License Agreement

## Security issues

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please read our [security policy](SECURITY.md) for more details.

## Reporting Issues

Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features,
by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information will increase
the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **Use Case** – explain your use case
* **Overview of the issue** – include stacktrace
* **Version** – which version you are using?
* **Browsers and Operating System** – is this a problem with all browsers?
* **Reproduce the Error** – provide a patch against app to reproduce the error
* **Related Issues** – has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** – you can point to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)

Please make sure you don’t post any sensitive information while reporting issues.
